# Core Maintainer Elections

On the Community Toolkit team, we strongly believe that core maintainers should come from the community and be elected by the community. 

We hold yearly elections each year in July, finalizing the election results at the [August Monthly Standup](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui/wiki/Monthly-Standups).

Candidates should first read through our [Core Team Responsibilities](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui/wiki/Core-Team-Tools-and-Responsibilities#responsibilities) to ensure you are able to commit to the team for a minimum of one (1) year, are able to attend our monthly standup, and are able to contribute a minimum of one activity per week. 

To nominate yourself, write a top-level comment below in this Discussion introducing yourself to the community and highlighting why you'd make the best core maintainer!

Candidates' self-nomination should include, but is not limited to, the following details about yourself:
- Years of open-source experience
- Years of .NET MAUI experience (can also include Xamarin experience)
- Links to contributions, bug reports, discussions (etc.) to the [CommunityToolkit organization](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit) 
  - Can include contributions to the [Xamarin.CommunityToolkit](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarincommunitytoolkit)
  - Can include contributions to the [CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup](https://github.com/communitytoolkit/maui.markup)
- Links to other open-source projects you maintain
- New Proposals + Bug Fixes you will contribute to the .NET MAUI Community Toolkits
- Proficiency in English + Other languages 
  - The .NET MAUI Community Toolkit conducts all Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, Standups, etc in English
  - A multi-lingual core maintainers is a HUGE bonus given the vast diversity of our community
    - Our current team covers Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Ukrainian and Korean

And similar to the [StackOverflow Moderator Elections](https://stackoverflow.com/election/14 ), we seek core core maintainers who exemplify the following traits:

- Patient and fair
- Leads by example
- Shows respect for their fellow community members in their actions and words
- Open to some light but firm moderation to keep the community on track, and resolve uncommon disputes and exceptions

The nominees who receive the most upvotes will join the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit Core Maintainer Team.
